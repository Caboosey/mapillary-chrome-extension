Mapillary Chrome extension
===================

Browser extension for [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) that shows a random beautiful image from [Mapillary](https://www.mapillary.com) every time you open a new tab. Uses [MapillaryJS](https://github.com/mapillary/mapillary-js) to allow you to explore the images further. Download it on the [Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mapillary-%E2%80%93-crowdsourced/lkokbfpnhgcnkhecedjgdemlohbaomjd)

## Install

Clone this repo.

`npm install`

## Running

`npm start` will start a local server and open a new tab with the page.

Alternatively, you can navigate to `chrome://extensions` in Chrome and drag-and-drop the whole folder there. That way you'll install the extension and it will also update automatically as you change the code.

## Customizing

You'll need a `clientId` from Mapillary to be able to use the [Mapillary](https://www.mapillary.com) every time you open a new tab. Uses [MapillaryJS](https://github.com/mapillary/mapillary-js) viewer. You can create one on [your Mapillary profile page](http://www.mapillary.com/map/settings/integrations).
